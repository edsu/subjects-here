Subjects-Here is just an html5 experiment, which uses the 
geo-location features in modern browsers to look up your location 
in OCLC's `mapFAST <http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/mapFAST>`_
webservice and display the library subject headings that are relevant
for your current location. If you click on one of the subjects you'll
be taken to a list of titles in `WorldCat <http://worldcat.org>`_
on that topic.
